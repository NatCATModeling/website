#Modeling Conflict Duration:
#Insights from Ensemble Learning

I investigate why *some* wars last longer than others. Challenging the dominant rationalist paradigm that champions credible commitment problems as the primary culprit for the longevity of civil wars, I focus on making accurate temporal predictions based on the structural determinants that leverage the maximum variation in data. More specifically, I posit a theory of strategic decision-making under constraints, in a world where absolute and relative capabilities---material, physical, and political---determine the outcome.

My empirical strategy is as follows. First, using the Cunningham and Lemke [(2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/combining-civil-and-interstate-wars/F58D663E5D6896BFFC84A1406713B849) data, which contains features on both interstate and civil wars, I explore the determinants of conflict duration. Second, I replicate approx. 40 studies on conflict duration published since 2004. I train various machine learning algorithms on the duration studies to identify and compare variable importance measures across studies. Finally, I train deep learning models using Keras on the Cunningham and Lemke dataset to capture the complex underlying interactions and make temporal predictions.

Although ensemble learning is a machine learning concept---a committee of weak learners aggregating into a strong learner---I utilize it in two ways in my dissertation. First, I use a diverse set of algorithms, which have their own strengths and weaknesses, to maximize predictive accuracy. But the whole enterprise can be seen as ensemble learning as well---by combining traditional large-*n* research, machine learning, and a shadow case study, I aim to make a strong empirical case for conceptualizing conflict duration in an unified way.

The dissertation is set to be submitted by July 2018.
