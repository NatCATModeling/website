<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my new website. I will briefly lay out my MO in this post. The primary reason why I switched from my old academic website in favor of a more functional (modern?) version is one of pure convenience. Nowadays, I have been building interactive web applications, mainly <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny apps and dashboards</a>, for work and as a hobby. Consequently, I needed a central hub to host all the apps in one outlet.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hopefully, there will also be occassional data visualization posts, as well as passing around code in R and Python.</p>

<div id="about-the-website" class="section level3">
<h3>About the Website</h3>
<p>This webpage is built by using the <code>blogdown</code> package in R. In turn, the package utilizes a static-site generator called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and I use a variation of the theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/">cactus plus</a>. As per the recommendation of Amber Thomas and Yihui Xie,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I host my site on <a href="https://netlify.com">netlify.com</a>, which offers continuous deployment from a git repository. All I have to do is to create a new Markdown/RMarkdown document and within seconds it will be deployed to the website. Pretty neat.</p>

<h3>RMarkdown</h3>
<p>Speaking of RMarkdown, the logo of the website is created via the <code>sunburstR</code> package. The data shown are not artifically constructed; the graph indeed shows the breakdown of female author inclusion patterns in IR syllabi at the LSE for the 2015-2016 academic year. Hovering on the dial will display a breadcrumb trail on the top. Below you can find the R code used to generate the graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(sunburstR)
library(htmlwidgets)

patch &lt;- read_csv(&quot;patch.csv&quot;) #Sequence data for included publications written by female authors

#Assigning palettes to vectors so that we can ignore extremely light/dark colors via subsetting later

blues &lt;- c(brewer.pal(9, &quot;Blues&quot;))
reds &lt;- c(brewer.pal(9, &quot;Reds&quot;))

htmlwidgets::onRender(
      sunburst(patch, count = TRUE,
               legend = list(w = 150, h = 25, s = 5, t = 25),
               breadcrumb = list(w = 0, h = 25, s = 5, t = 10),
               colors = c(&quot;&quot;, blues[1:8], reds[7:2]), #For some reason, I had to assign a blank color first for
               #the palette sequences to work as intended
               legendOrder = c(&quot;1960&quot;, &quot;1970&quot;, &quot;1980&quot;, &quot;1990&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;,
                               &quot;Book&quot;, &quot;Article&quot;,
                               &quot;OtherPublisher&quot;, &quot;TopPublisher&quot;,
                               &quot;CoAuthored&quot;, &quot;SingleAuthored&quot;,
                               &quot;MaleCoAuthor&quot;, &quot;FemaleCoAuthor&quot;)),
      &quot;
      function(el, x){
      d3.select(el).select(&#39;.sunburst-togglelegend&#39;).property(&#39;checked&#39;,true);
      d3.select(el).select(&#39;.sunburst-togglelegend&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;)();

<p>The JavaScript code chunk at the end is supposed to <a href="https://github.com/timelyportfolio/sunburstR/issues/15">simulate a click</a> so that the legend box is checked and expanded automatically on launch, however it stopped working for me after a while (so you have to toggle it manually). Maybe a package update to <code>htmlwidgets</code> or <code>sunburstR</code> somehow broke it? Still, I left it in there in case you want to work it out yourself.</p>
