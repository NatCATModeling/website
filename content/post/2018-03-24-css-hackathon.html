<p>Whew! Less than a month left and I still haven’t publicised this on my blog. People, we are hosting the 1<sup>st</sup> Computational Social Science Hackathon at the London School of Economics and <strong>you are invited!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s completely <strong>free</strong> and open to <strong>all</strong>. With that said, we will prioritise students/recent graduates and participants from the under-represented segments of the society. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds for providing travel grants.</p></li>
<li><p>We will take care of all catering throughout the event. Once your place is confirmed, you will be able to tell us any dietary requirements you might have. Attendance is capped, but set tentatively for now.</p></li>
<li><p>On that note, we will also ask for your t-shirt size. Tote-bags come in single-size ;) Freebies for everyone!</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub offered to provide a prize pack for the winning team and we didn’t say no!</p></li>
<li><p>No sleepovers! The event starts at 10am and finishes as 9pm on both days. Go out with your team-mates, do something social (hello, London), have herbal tea and go to bed early—your call, we don’t judge.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>We aim to have four distinct computational social science challenges. Currently, we have three challenge-issuers confirmed: LSE Social and Economic Data Science (SEDS), GitHub, and Facebook Research. We are still reaching out for the fourth, so if you happen to know a suitable institution/company/NGO/start-up, send them our way! We will publicise the challenges a week before the event.</p>
<p>The first day of our event (that is, 17 April), is actually a pre-event. That is, no hacking will take place. Instead, that evening (6-8pm) is for getting your badges, watching videos of the challenges (sponsors themselves won’t be there for the pre-event), and team-forming. You should definitely <strong>not</strong> skip this day<del>, even though the poster makes it look like you can!</del><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Do mingle with the others—drinks are on us.</p>

<div id="workshops" class="section level3">
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>We have a wide range of workshops that will run in parallel to the main event. That is, you can take a time-out from hacking and enjoy one of our beginner-friendly workshops.</p>
