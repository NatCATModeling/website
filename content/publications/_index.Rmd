Gokhan Ciflikli and Nils Metternich. __Improving civil war duration prediction with ensemble learning.__

This paper introduces the first survival ensemble approach to improve predictive accuracy in conflict studies. We present a framework for making temporal forecasts of ethnic conflict build on actor and group configurations. Using EPR data to identify which ethnic groups are part of the government and rebel organizations, we build an ensemble tree model for ethnic conflict duration prediction. In comparison to mainstream statistical models, the random forest algorithm we employ reduces prediction error by at least 3\% and at most 26\% in existing influential studies on civil war duration.

Nils Metternich, Gokhan Ciflikli, Ali Altaf, and Tatjana Stankovic. __Predicting the severity of civil Wars: An actor-centric approach.__

This paper introduces RebelTrack and RebelCast, which consist of a set of functions to measure rebel behaviour, characteristics, and configurations. Using mainly data from the UCDP GED dataset in combination with PRIO grid data, RebelTrack establishes an open-development platform to generate theory and data-driven information on rebel organizations. RebelTrack will be delivered as an R package with an open access Github platform for further development and improvement of existing indicators. The RebelTrack package with be updated yearly, with beta versions running on Github for users to access the latest indicators. RebelCast will also develop user requested measures that will included in the annual and beta releases. Data generation and data provision comply with the Data Access and Research Transparency (DA-RT) initiative, which enables researchers using RebelTrack to submit their work to the leading journals in political science and beyond. This includes the provision of a detailed codebook, download date of original data, version number of original data, complete code, and the original data.
