<p>I am a <strong>data scientist</strong> specialising in <strong>machine learning, time-series forecasting, and natural language processing.</strong> I am proficient in R, Python, and SQL.</p>
<p>My core expertise lies in</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-Series Forecasting: using supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) to solve binary- and multi-classification problems</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): making sense of unstructured text using web-scraping and industrial solutions (i.e.Â SpaCy, quanteda)</li>
<li>Data Visualisation: producing interactive presentations (R-Shiny, reveal.js, D3) to gain insights from data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I am a software developer at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli">Department of Methodology</a> at the London School of Economics. As a member of the <a href="https://quanteda.org/people/">Quanteda Initiative</a>, I am responsible for developing a GUI for the <a href="https://quanteda.io/"><code>quanteda</code></a> package in R. In addition, I am a <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495">research scientist</a> at Uppsala University working on (in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en">Research Institutes of Swedenâ€“RISE</a>) the automation of the <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/">Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)</a> using natural language processing (NLP) and active learning.</p>
<p>Most of my side projects are on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a> (work projects are seldomly public, unfortunately). I contribute my blog to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>.</p>
