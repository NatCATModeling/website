<p>Click <a href="/img/Ciflikli_CV_280319.pdf">here</a> for my resume.</p>
<p>I’m a <strong>computational social scientist</strong> specialising in <strong>conflict forecasting.</strong></p>
<p>My core research focuses on <strong>predictive models</strong> of armed conflict dynamics; <strong>problematising</strong> the tensions between explanatory versus predictive research; <strong>textual analysis</strong> of political violence event-data; and the <strong>quantification</strong> of issues of representation and bias in social science research.</p>
<p>My methodological work revolves around making black box machine learning findings more human-friendly, introducing new procedures for cross-validating models using binary-time-series-cross-section data, and developing a random forest algorithm that can deal with time-varying covariates.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli">Department of Methodology</a> at the London School of Economics. As a member of the <a href="https://quanteda.org/people/">Quanteda Initiative</a>, I am responsible for developing a GUI for the <a href="https://quanteda.io/"><code>quanteda</code></a> package in R. I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/">CSS London initiative</a>. In addition, I am a <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495">research scientist</a> at Uppsala University working on (in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en">Research Institutes of Sweden–RISE</a>) the automation of the <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/">Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)</a> using natural language processing (NLP).</p>
<p>I take inspiration from statistical mechanics and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/">mainstream statistical</a> and <a href="/img/algo.jpg">advanced machine learning</a> tools to solve various social science problems at the intersection of conflict studies, political science, and international relations.</p>
<p>Most of my work is on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a>. I am happy to contribute my blog to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>.</p>
