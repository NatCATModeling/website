<p>Click <a href="/img/Ciflikli_CV_260219.pdf">here</a> for my resume.</p>
<p>I’m a computational social scientist by training and a member of the <a href="http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/">CSS London initiative</a>. I currently work as an analytic software developer for the <a href="https://quanteda.org/people/">Quanteda Initiative</a> hosted at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli">Methodology Department</a> of London School of Economics. My ongoing research primarily focuses on predictive modelling, political methodology relating to modelling binary-time-series-cross-sectional (BTSCS) data, out-of-sample cross-validation techniques, and making ‘black box’ machine learning findings more human-friendly.</p>
<p>More specifically, I am interested in exploring how inward looking (explanatory, in-sample) and outward looking (predictive, out-of-sample) social science research can be synthesized together with an emphasis on armed conflict onset and duration, which was the focus of my Ph.D dissertation. I am also a <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495">research scientist</a> working on an automated newspaper reporting extraction project using natural language processing (NLP) at Uppsala University (Sweden), in conjunction
with <a href="https://www.ri.se/en">Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE)</a>.</p>
<p>I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/">mainstream statistical</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1838/">machine learning</a> tools to solve various social science problems at hand. Most of my work is on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a>. I happily contribute my posts to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>. Check out <a href="https://www.r-users.com/">R-Users</a> as well, a job posting platform for R enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Other than all the serious-sounding stuff above, I also enjoy dabbling in NBA analytics (Let’s Go #LakeShow!), writing dystopian sci-fi, and graphic design.</p>
