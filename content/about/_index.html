<p>I’m an analytic software developer at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics. A computational social scientist by training and a member of the <a href="http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/">CSS London initiative</a>, I like to visualise empirical problems and to offer data-driven explanations for social phenomena. Although my academic interests revolve around exploring violent conflict dynamics, identifying the determinants of strategic decision-making, and quantifying gender and diversity issues in academia, I broadly consider myself a social scientist: I’m primarily interested in answering the question <em>why people do the things they do,</em> one bit at a time.</p>
<p>I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/">mainstream statistical</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1838/">machine learning</a> tools to solve the problem at hand. Most of my work is on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a>. I happily contribute my posts to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>. Check out <a href="https://www.r-users.com/">R-Users</a> as well, a job posting platform for R enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Other than all the serious-sounding stuff above, I also enjoy dabbling in NBA analytics (Let’s Go #LakeShow!), writing dystopian sci-fi, and graphic design.</p>
