<p>Click <a href="/img/Ciflikli_CV_280219.pdf">here</a> for my resume.</p>
<p>I’m a computational social scientist and a member of the <a href="http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/">CSS London initiative</a>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli">Methodology Department</a> of the London School of Economics. As a member of the <a href="https://quanteda.org/people/">Quanteda Initiative</a>, I am responsible for developing a GUI for the <a href="https://quanteda.io/"><code>quanteda</code></a> package in R.</p>
<p>In addition, I am a <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495">research scientist</a> at Uppsala University (in conjunction
with the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en">Research Institutes of Sweden–RISE</a>) on an automated newspaper report extraction project using natural language processing.</p>
<p>My ongoing research primarily focuses on predictive models of armed conflict dynamics, structural tensions between explanatory versus predictive research, textual analysis of political violence event data; as well as the issues of representation and bias in social science research.</p>
<p>I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/">mainstream statistical</a> and <a href="/img/algo.jpg">advanced machine learning</a> tools to solve various social science problems at the intersection of conflict studies, political science, and international relations.</p>
<p>Most of my work is on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a>. I happily contribute my posts to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>. Check out <a href="https://www.r-users.com/">R-Users</a> as well, a job posting platform for R enthusiasts.</p>
