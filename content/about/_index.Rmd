Click [here](/img/Ciflikli_CV_280219.pdf) for my resume.

I'm a computational social scientist and a member of the [CSS London initiative](http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/). Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Methodology Department](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli) of the London School of Economics. As a member of the [Quanteda Initiative](https://quanteda.org/people/), I am responsible for developing a GUI for the [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io/) package in R.

In addition, I am a [research scientist](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495) at Uppsala University (in conjunction 
with the [Research Institutes of Sweden--RISE](https://www.ri.se/en)) on an automated newspaper report extraction project using natural language processing.

My ongoing research primarily focuses on predictive models of armed conflict dynamics, structural tensions between explanatory versus predictive research, textual analysis of political violence event data; as well as the issues of representation and bias in social science research.

I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various [mainstream statistical](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/) and [advanced machine learning](/img/algo.jpg) tools to solve various social science problems at the intersection of conflict studies, political science, and international relations.

Most of my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ciflikli). I happily contribute my posts to [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/). Check out [R-Users](https://www.r-users.com/) as well, a job posting platform for R enthusiasts.
