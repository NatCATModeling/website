Click the link for my [resume](/img/Ciflikli_CV_310818.pdf).

I'm an analytic software developer at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics. My main responsibility is to develop a scalable Shiny application for the [Quanteda Initiative](https://quanteda.org). A computational social scientist by training and a member of the [CSS London initiative](http://www.csslondoninitiative.co.uk/people/), I like to visualise empirical problems and to offer data-driven explanations for social phenomena. Although my academic interests revolve around exploring violent conflict dynamics, identifying the determinants of strategic decision-making, and quantifying gender and diversity issues in academia, I broadly consider myself a social scientist: I'm primarily interested in answering the question _why people do the things they do,_ one bit at a time.

I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various [mainstream statistical](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/) and [machine learning](https://xkcd.com/1838/) tools to solve the problem at hand. Most of my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ciflikli). I happily contribute my posts to [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/). Check out [R-Users](https://www.r-users.com/) as well, a job posting platform for R enthusiasts.

Other than all the serious-sounding stuff above, I also enjoy dabbling in NBA analytics (Let's Go #LakeShow!), writing dystopian sci-fi, and graphic design.
