I'm a political scientist (PhD candidate@[LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk/)) by training who likes to visualize empirical problems and offer data-driven solutions. Although my academic interests revolve around explaining the temporal variation in armed conflict duration, identifying the determinants of U.S. foreign policy, and quantifying gender issues in academia, I broadly consider myself a social scientist: I'm primarily interested in answering _(one bit at a time)_ the question _why do people do the things they do?_

To do so, I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allows me to employ various [mainstream statistical](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/) and [machine learning](https://xkcd.com/1838/) tools to the data problem at hand.

Other than all the serious-sounding stuff above, I also enjoy dabbling in NBA analytics (Let's Go #LakeShow!), dystopian sci-fi, and graphic design.
