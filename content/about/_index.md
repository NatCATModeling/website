I'm a political scientist by training (PhD candidate@[LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk/)) who likes to visualize empirical problems and to offer data-driven explanations for social phenomena. Although my academic interests revolve around exploring violent conflict dynamics, identifying the determinants of foreign policy decision-making, and quantifying gender issues in academia, I broadly consider myself a social scientist: I'm primarily interested in answering the question _why people do the things they do,_ one bit at a time.

I take inspiration from physics, biology, and complex systems theory, which allow me to employ various [mainstream statistical](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/09/23/data-science-statistics-communication/) and [machine learning](https://xkcd.com/1838/) tools to solve the problem at hand. Most of my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ciflikli).

Other than all the serious-sounding stuff above, I also enjoy dabbling in NBA analytics (Let's Go #LakeShow!), dystopian sci-fi, and graphic design.
