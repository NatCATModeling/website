Here are some of the data projects I am currently working on. Links to Shiny apps and code on GitHub will be made public when a project is published.

`duRation` An ensemble ML app that takes survival analysis as input, transforms it to logistic regression, and runs a series of classification models using `caret` to increase predictive accuracy.

`genderIR` A thorough author-gender analysis of nearly 14,000 publications included in reading lists constituting the IR programme - Undergrad, Masters and PhD levels - at the LSE during the 2015-16 academic year.
