Here are some of the data projects I am currently working on. Links to Shiny apps and code on GitHub will be made public when a project is published.


###Individual Projects

***

`adavis` Visual exploration of nearly 36,000 US legislator voting scores as recorded by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) from 1948 to 2015. The data is grouped by year, state, chamber, and party. [App Link](https://gokhan.shinyapps.io/adavis/) |  [GitHub](https://github.com/ciflikli/adavis)

`gendeR` Thorough author-gender analysis of nearly 13,000 publications included in reading lists constituting the International Relations programme---Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD levels---at the London School of Economics during the 2015-16 academic year.

`duRation` Ensemble ML app that takes survival analysis as input, transforms it to logistic regression, and runs a series of classification models using `caret` to increase predictive accuracy. Currently under development.
